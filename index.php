<b>The dilemna I've had since Covid-19 entered my life will come to an end.</b><br>
<b>Thought it was happiness, but it was not.</b><br> 
<b>Yet, I'm glad it came to my life for I had realized a lot. But now I'm letting go.</b><br>
<b> I'm moving on. I want my life to be normal. I want everyone to live normally again and Covid-19 to leave us all alone.</b><br><br><br>

<b> This year, I'm hoping for something else to arrive. A pure bag of happiness and a sack of hope. </b><br>
<b>I want to see people having hope again and the World to regain it's strength and to be cured.</b><br>
<b>Covid-19 had been somehow great and had made miserable things in my life, in everyones lives.</b><br><br><br>
<i> But, I want all of you to know that still; Life Goes On </i><br><br>

<b> Yeah, life goes on</b><br>
